It is a powerful library to manage data in the React app. It provides a simple and easy way to handle data fetching, and catching with the server. 

Here Axios acts as a queryFn for useQuery and useMutation hooks. 

By combining React Query with Axios, we can create a robust data management solution that is easy to use and maintain.

In this repo. I provide a sample API to get data and update the data by using useQuery and useMutation.

To install react-query

npm i react-query axios 
  or 
yarn add react-query axios
